===============================

Generated: 2025-10-28 11:41:45

DETECTED BIASES
----------------
• Selection Bias

RECOMMENDED REMEDIATION STEPS
------------------------------
1. Implement walk-forward optimization instead of single-period optimization
2. Use out-of-sample validation on unseen data segments
3. Apply multiple testing corrections (Bonferroni, Holm-Bonferroni)
4. Reduce parameter optimization space to prevent over-searching

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------
1. Split data into training/validation/out-of-sample sets (60/20/20)
2. Use cross-validation with rolling time windows
3. Implement parameter stability tests across market regimes
4. Add economic rationale constraints to parameter selection

VALIDATION RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------
1. Verify Sharpe ratio remains stable out-of-sample
2. Check parameter distributions are reasonable
3. Validate against random parameter sets (reality check test)
4. Test strategy on different market regimes

Bias Remediation Summary
========================

Detected Biases: 1
Recommended Actions: 4

Priority Actions:
Implement walk-forward optimization instead of single-period optimization Use out-of-sample validation on unseen data segments Apply multiple testing corrections (Bonferroni, Holm-Bonferroni)

This remediation plan addresses potential data-mining artifacts and ensures
strategy robustness through proper validation and testing procedures.

Critical Success Factors:
• Implement walk-forward testing immediately
• Apply multiple testing corrections
• Focus on out-of-sample performance
• Validate economic rationale regularly
